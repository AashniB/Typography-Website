                    <p>Fenty grew up in Barbados with a Barbadian father and a Guyanese mother. As a child, she listened
                        to Caribbean music, such as reggae, as well as American hip-hop and R&B. She especially enjoyed
                        singing and won a high-school talent show with a rendition of a Mariah Carey song. About the
                        same time, she started a girl group with two friends, and in 2004 she attracted the attention of
                        Evan Rogers, an American record producer. He helped Fenty record a demo that led to an audition
                        with the rapper Jay-Z, who at the time headed the Def Jam record label, and he soon signed the

                    <p> With the effervescent dancehall-inflected single “Pon de Replay” (2005), Rihanna immediately
                        captured an international audience. The songs success buoyed sales for her debut full-length
                        recording, Music of the Sun (2005), on which conventional R&B ballads shared space with
                        Caribbean-flavoured dance-pop that showcased her melodious Barbadian lilt. Rihanna soon followed
                        with the album A Girl like Me (2006), featuring the up-tempo club-oriented “S.O.S.” <a
